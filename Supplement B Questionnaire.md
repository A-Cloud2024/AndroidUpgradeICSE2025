# Supplement B    Questionnaire Design

## Background

Mobile vendors develop their customized Android versions based on the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) led by Google. As the AOSP releases new versions frequently, vendors need to periodically carry out the Android upgrade. Both the AOSP and Android variants independently undergo extensive and complex modifications. Consequently, Android upgrades often lead to compatibility issues and conflicts. To systematically define, study, and resolve these conflicts during the Android upgrade process, we kindly request you to dedicate 15 minutes to complete the following survey. Your participation will greatly assist us in gathering insights. This survey will be anonymized, focusing solely on trends and improvement suggestions.

## Questionnaire Questions Design

==The complete Questionnaire can be found in [Questionnaire](./Questionnaire%20Questions.md  )==

This questionnaire primarily covers the experiences and challenges faced by Android developers during the conflict resolution process in Android upgrades. It includes aspects such as the modules they are responsible for, the number of upgrades they have participated in, their work experience, reasons of conflicts, conflict resolution, technical challenges, use of tools, team collaboration, stress levels, and experience sharing.

*►[Personal Information]*

- **Android Business Modules**: Which features or modules are you primarily responsible for developing? [Text Question P1]
- **Number of Participations in Android Upgrade Processes**: How many versions have you participated in conflict resolution for system upgrades? [Single Choice Question P2]
- **Level of Work Experience**: How many years of Android work experience do you have? [Single Choice Question P3]
- **Total Number of Conflicts Resolved**: How many conflicts have you resolved in total? [Single Choice Question P4]

*►[Conflict Causes and Types]*

- **Conflict Causes**: 
   1. Based on your experience, what do you think are the causes of conflicts? [Text Question P10]
   2. How often do you review Google commits and self-developed commits when analyzing the causes of conflicts? [Single Choice Question P14]

- **Conflict Types**:
   1. What types of conflicts have you resolved during the conflict resolution process? [Multiple Choice Question P5]
   2. Which specific types of conflicts are more difficult to handle? [Multiple Choice Question P16]

*►[Conflict Resolution]*

- **Conflict Resolution Process and Time**:
   1. How many steps does your process for resolving a single conflict in codex involve? (Your understanding of conflicts is important for tool development and training) [Text Question P6]
   2. How many steps does your process for resolving a single conflict involve? What is the time distribution for each step? [Text Question P12]
   3. How long does it typically take to resolve a complex conflict? Does it require assistance from other engineers, such as voice models or conflict change commits? [Text Question P13]
   4. What is the total time allocated for your conflict resolution tasks? [Single Choice Question P11]
- **Conflict Resolution Methods**:
   1. Which conflict resolution methods do you use more frequently? [Multiple Choice Question P7]
   2. How do you handle conflict code that repeatedly appears in multiple versions? [Multiple Choice Question P9]
- **Technical and Tool Challenges**:
   1. What technical challenges do you usually encounter when resolving merge conflicts? [Text Question P15]
   2. What tools or resources do you typically use when handling conflicts? [Text Question P21]
   3. Have these tools effectively helped you reduce conflict resolution time or improve efficiency? [Text Question P22]
   4. When using existing tools, what issues do you think still need improvement or optimization? [Text Question P28]
   5. Based on your experience, what methods or tools do you think could improve the current conflict resolution process? [Text Question P27]
- **Familiarity with Historical Solutions**:
   1. Resolving conflicts requires understanding Google's historical solutions. Please help assess your familiarity with these solutions. (4 - Not very familiar, each solution needs to be understood from the basic architectural principles; 6 - Need to individually review commits and understand historical solutions; 10 - Very familiar, no need to review commits, and already know the solution) [Text Question P17]
   2. Resolving conflicts requires understanding self-developed project historical solutions. Please help assess your familiarity with these solutions. (4 - Not very familiar, each solution needs to be understood from the basic architectural principles; 6 - Need to individually review commits and understand historical solutions; 10 - Very familiar, no need to review commits, and already know the solution) [Text Question P18]
   3. Resolving conflicts requires understanding Google's new upgrade solutions. Please help assess your familiarity with these solutions. (4 - Not very familiar, each change needs to be understood from the basic architectural principles; 6 - Need to individually review commits and understand historical solutions; 10 - Very familiar, thorough initial commit analysis, can quickly recall issues) [Text Question P19]

*►[Conflict Impact Analysis]*

- Does the conflict resolution process involve code or files outside the conflict blocks? [Single Choice Question P8]

*►[Other]*

- **Team Management**:
   1. During the conflict resolution process, which team members (e.g., other developers, testers, project managers) do you usually need to collaborate with? [Text Question P23]
   2. Is the collaboration effective, and is there room for improvement? [Text Question P24]
- **Stress and Support**:
